## Motivation for this project
Ever wondered what the React Magic is all about?

After self-learning React's mechanism of state-hooks and element rendering, I implemented my own "Little React" that mimicks the original framework.

Of course, the real React is way more complicated with a lot of optimisation, but I hope this little project reveals some fundamental ideas of component rendering and state management, hence strengthens out understanding of the React framework.

## To setup
1. Go to root directory(where "index.html" is located)
2. Run `npm install -g live-server`
3. Run `live-server`
